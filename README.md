# shamey-wagon-wheel-watusi

A free, open-source RedM script that just deletes those annoying floating padlocks in base RedM servers. The padlocks create invisible blocks in the roads that characters might crash into. This is one of the first RedM scripts I ever wrote. I'm still not sure why the padlocks appear, stay stuck, and have collision, but regardless, this fixes it.

## Requirements
- VORP Framework (just for debugging, so if you use another framework you can just delete the VORP stuff)

## License & Support
This software was formerly proprietary to Rainbow Railroad Roleplay, but I am now releasing it free and open-source under GNU GPLv3. I cannot provide any support.
